# üõ†Ô∏è C-Compiler (Sandbox Project)

This is a basic C compiler built for experimentation and educational exploration. It is part of a sandbox environment to understand compiler design principles such as:

- Lexical Analysis
- Parsing
- Code Generation

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This project is not intended for production use. It is a personal sandbox to test and learn.

## üîß How It Works

- **i.** This compiler converts high-level C code into binary (machine code).
- **ii.** The output is an executable file named `a.out` by default.
- **iii.** The main source code file is `main.c`.
- **iv.** Compile the program using:
  ```bash
  
  gcc main.c
Run the program with   ./a.out
