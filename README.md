# üõ†Ô∏è C-Compiler (Sandbox Project)

This is a basic C compiler built for experimentation and educational exploration.
It is part of a sandbox environment

 This project is not intended for production use. It is a personal sandbox to test and learn.

##  How It Works

- **i.** The output is an executable file named `a.out` by default.
- **ii.** The main source code file is `main.c`.
- **iii.** Compile the program using:  `gcc main.c`.
- **iv.** Run the program with   `./a.out`.
